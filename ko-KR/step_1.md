When we want to represent a colour in a computer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that are combined to make up that colour. These amounts are stored as a number between 0 and 255.

Here's a table showing some colour values:

| 적색  | 녹색  | 청색  | Colour  |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| 255 | 0   | 0   | 적색      |
| 0   | 255 | 0   | 녹색      |
| 0   | 0   | 255 | 청색      |
| 255 | 255 | 0   | 노란색     |
| 255 | 0   | 255 | Magenta |
| 0   | 255 | 255 | Cyan    |

You can find a nice [colour picker to play with at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp){:target="_blank"}.
