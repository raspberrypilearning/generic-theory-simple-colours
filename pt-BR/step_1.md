When we want to represent a colour in a computer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that make up that colour. These amounts are usually stored as a single byte and therefore as a number between 0 and 255.

Here's a table showing some colour values:

| Vermelho | Verde | Azul | Colour   |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| 255      | 0     | 0    | Vermelho |
| 0        | 255   | 0    | Verde    |
| 0        | 0     | 255  | Azul     |
| 255      | 255   | 0    | Amarelo  |
| 255      | 0     | 255  | Magenta  |
| 0        | 255   | 255  | Cyan     |
